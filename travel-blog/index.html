      <h2>A Weekend on the seine</h2>
      <p>
        I was lucky enough to spend three<br> days visiting Paris this month! I<br> went with a friend and we were able <br>to see many things while we were <br>there!
      </p>
      <h4 id=Day1>Day 1</h4>
      <p>
        On our first day, we started by <br>visiting<em> Montmartre </em>right away. Our <br>second stop was the Eiffel Tower <br>(check out that beautiful picture!)<br> We ate dinner at a cute little bistro<br> overlooking la <em>Seine</em>.

      <h4 id=Day2>Day 2</h4>
      <p>
        On our second day, we went shopping <br>on <em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>. Every<br> single person we saw was dressed in <br>the height of fashion.<br><br>After we finished shopping, we <br>visited some really beautiful places!<br> We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a <br>macaron tour of Paris and ate all of<br> the best macarons the city had to <br>offer. After we finished shopping, we<br> visited <em>le Louvre</em>.

      <h4 id=Day3>Day 3</h4>
      <p>
        The picture below is of me visiting<br> the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge! We <br>also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing <br>the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van <br>Gogh in person was completely <br>breathtaking. I was surprised to see <br>that the museum also had many <br>sculptures including those by Auguste<br> Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred <br>Barye.
